# Deterministic Optimal Control Using Geographic Point Cloud Datasets #
A repository for all code and documentation related to my MATH 496 T (Mathematics of Generative AI) final project, where I utilize 
publically available USGS Geotiff files to find the optimum path through the terrain generated from the point cloud data set. 

Please see my projects tab to see the latest plans and changes coming to the repository to stay updated!
